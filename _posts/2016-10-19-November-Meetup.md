In a valiant attempt to hold more than one meetup in 2016, we're pleased to announce that we've got another one lined up for November. We've even got a bit of a treat for you in the form of some prizes to give away: we'll have a personal license for the wonderful [Reveal app](http://revealapp.com) by [Itty Bitty Apps](http://ittybittyapps.com), and [Maurice Kelly](http://twitter.com/mauricerkelly) and [Mark Goody](http://twitter.com/marramgrass) have some copies of their most recent book [Build watchOS Apps](http://watchosapps.build/) to give away. You just have to be there to be in with a chance at both giveaways/

So join us in the *new* [ShopKeep](http://www.shopkeep.com/) offices (yes, they finally got moved, so don't go to their old spot) for some tech talks, as well as a bit of general socialising time. There's just been talk of an Apple Event being held on the 27th October, so there could be lots to discuss about new MacBook Pros. (RIP, USB ports)

The event is on Wednesday, 2nd November and we're gathering from 6:00pm with a view to kicking off at 7pm -- if you want to join us you can [signup at getinvited.com](https://getinvited.to/ns_belfast/nsbelfast-november-2016-meetup/)
