In a valiant attempt to hold more than one meetup in 2016, we're pleased to announce that we've got another one lined up for November. We've even got a bit of a treat for you in the form of some prizes to give away: we'll have a personal license for the wonderful [Reveal app](http://revealapp.com) by [Itty Bitty Apps](http://ittybittyapps.com), and [Maurice Kelly](http://twitter.com/mauricerkelly) and [Mark Goody](http://twitter.com/marramgrass) have some copies of their most recent book [Build watchOS Apps](http://watchosapps.build/) to give away. You just have to be there to be in with a chance at both giveaways/

* **Kyle Davidson**: Kyle is going to talk to us about building iMessage apps. He has recently released his first iMessage app [ScribbleStuff](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribblestuff/id1153429188?mt=8)
* **Andy Gough**: Andy is going to tell us about App Factories. What's an App Factory? You'd better come along and find out!

So join us in the *new* [ShopKeep](http://www.shopkeep.com/) offices (yes, they finally got moved, so don't go to their old spot) for some tech talks, as well as a bit of general socialising time.

The event is on Wednesday, 2nd November and we're gathering from 6:00pm with a view to kicking off at 7pm -- if you want to join us you can [signup at meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/NS_Belfast/events/234993408/)
