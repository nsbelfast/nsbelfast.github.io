Back in August [Niall](http://twitter.com/imnk) and [Iain](http://twitter.com/ominiom) talked us through the basics of ReactiveCocoa.  They've now made the code and slides public.  The talk was presented using [Deckset](http://twitter.com/decksetapp) so the slides are written in markdown and are in the root of the repository.

Enjoy! And feel free to get in touch with the guys for any ReactiveCocoa questions :)
