Thanks very much to all who attended this evenings event -- it was great to see so many people there and we're really enthused for the future of NSBelfast as a result.

At the the end of his talk on Swift, Mo threw a few reference URLs up on the screen that we'd like to reproduce here so that everyone can have a look.

* [Swift Programming Language on iBooks](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11)
* [Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/book/using-swift-cocoa-objective/id888894773?mt=11)
* [F**cking Swift Syntax](http://fuckingswiftsyntax.com/)
* [Swift tag on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/swift)

Additionally, while we were talking tonight Apple only went and released beta 3 of iOS 8 and Yosemite, and a new developer preview of Xcode 6. Apparently they have made a lot of changes to Swift, including fixing some of the issues that Mo mentioned in his talk. It seems Apple love to pull the rug out from under him.

## Next Event

Finally, just a quick reminder that the next event is being planned for the 18th August. The venue, and speakers are to be confirmed, but get the date in your calendar.
