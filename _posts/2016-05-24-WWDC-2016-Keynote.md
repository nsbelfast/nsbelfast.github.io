It's been one of those years where we kept promising to run events and yet nothing happened. Still, it's that season again, and so we've managed to get ourselves barely organised enough to arrange another WWDC Keynote viewing session.

We have a new host this year in the form of [Secure Broadcast](http://www.securebroadcast.com/), who have generously offered to provide us with a place to watch the Keynote live stream, and are going to provide some beer üç∫ and pizza üçï!

The event is on Monday, 13th June and we're gathering from 5:30pm -- if you want to join us you can [signup at getinvited.com](https://getinvited.to/ns_belfast/wwdc-nsbelfast-meetup/)
