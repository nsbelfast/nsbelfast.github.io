Over the last few months a few of us iOS developers in Belfast have been talking about getting what was Xcake up and running again, and here we are with a spanking new website and an event to tell you about - yay!

First of all we want to tell you a bit about our aims for this. We simply want to build a community of cocoa developers in Belfast who know each other, help each other and learn from each other. To do that we intend to hold monthly meetups and have a healthy mix of talks, labs, social and business events.

We are doing this (at least initially) without sponsorship or money of any kind to keep it neutral and community driven and we want the whole cocoa community of Northern Ireland to get involved if you want to. All contributions are welcome and we'll evolve NSBelfast over time to reflect what people want it to be.

A few questions you may have:

* Will I get free beer and pizza at your events? No, probably not to begin with, but you can bring your own. We'll update this on an event by event basis.
* Where will events be held? We hope to rotate it around various offices in Belfast with the help of some of our employers (for which we are very grateful).
* When will events be? We think Monday nights probably, but we can discuss that at the first meetup.
* How can I ask you guys a question or help out? In many ways:
    * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NSBelfast)
    * <a href='m&#97;i&#108;to&#58;tea&#109;&#64;n&#115;&#37;62e%6C&#102;as%74&#46;&#99;&#111;m'>Email us</a>
    * [GitHub](https://github.com/nsbelfast) - submit a pull request if you have any changes for the site or want to add an article, use issues for problems or chat.
    * [Trello](https://trello.com/b/KricJ6mK/nsbelfast) - we are trying this out as a public discussion board, let's see how that goes.
    
Our first meetup is going to be to watch the live stream (assuming there is one) from the WWDC keynote on June 2nd - [see here for details.](https://getinvited.to/nsbelfast/wwdc-2014-keynote/)

We would love to see as many people as possible there to enjoy the event then have a chat about how to move forward with NSBelfast.

Thanks for your time and see you all soon :)
